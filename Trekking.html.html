        <h2>Everest Base Camp Trek</h2>
        <p>Few experiences are as humbling as standing at the foot of the world’s tallest mountain. On the border between Tibet and Nepal, Mt Everest – known as Sagarmatha in Nepali and Chomolongma (or Qomolangma) in the Sherpa or Tibetan language – tops out at nearly 9km (5.5 miles). After trekking for at least a week to reach Everest Base Camp (EBC), with the prospect of more hiking days still ahead as you descend, the sight of this mighty mountain surrounded by its high-altitude friends is as emotional as it is beautiful.</p>

        <h2>Annapurna Circuit Trek</h2>
        <p>Until 1951, Nepal was off-limits for foreign travellers; a secretive, isolated kingdom kept under wraps from outsiders…

But a change of regime gave birth to a new era of travel, and Nepal has remained a magnet for intrepid adventurers for over 70 years.

It was the summiting of Annapurna I – before that of Everest – that captivated the world of mountaineering and turned the spotlight on Nepal as an outdoor-lover’s haven in the Indian subcontinent.

This guide will offer everything you need to know to explore the majestic Annapurna region and get to grips with experiencing Nepal on foot. There’s a magical culture of generosity and kindness to discover, against a backdrop of some of the most impressive peaks to be found anywhere on earth.</p>
